# TCPPrism

Mirrors TCP traffic between a `client` and a `forward` host, but also sends the same traffic to a `mirror` host. The response from the `mirror` is thrown away.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/84codes/tcpprism.git
cd tcpprism
shards build --release --production
install bin/tcpprism /usr/local/bin/
```

Or [download precompiled binaries](https://github.com/84codes/tcpprism/releases).
